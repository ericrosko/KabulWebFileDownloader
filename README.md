# Kabul Web File Downloader

### Author

### Description
The purpose of this python 3 script is to be able to download all jpg files from a webpage.   It requires that all files end in jpg and don't have any spaces.

It simply does what it needed to do for me and successfully download all images from a very slow server that kept locking me out.  It can easily be modified in the future to support multiple extensions or those pesky images with spaces in the names!

The name Kabul comes from the project I'm currently working on.

### Usage
python3 ./kabul_download.py http://your-website/image-folder
